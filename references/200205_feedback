-Stop using passive voice
-Use storytelling of why recycling is important
-Add personal slide
-Show pictures of recycling bins in data pipeline slide
-Conclusions slide
-Ditch scientific notation on confusion matrix
-Performance for specific classes was good! Maybe show missclassifed images
-False positives are worse than false negatives
-Make class imbalance graphs horizontal, label y-axis

- Example of misclassified classes (data slide)
- Make class labels bigger on confusion matrix
- Be more concrete about improvements
- Include misclassified images/convolutional filters
- Mention how bad false positives are

- Too much text on algorithm slide, data story and problem statement
- Add more slides/transitions
- Still too much passive voice
- Happier about model
- Make a big deal about building a prototype (draw a smartbin)
- Use larger prediction labels in demo slide
- Don't move cursor
- Mention extensibility
- Multi-cultural universities result in confusion. Maybe make a narrative?
- Reiterate why these two universities were chosen

- Add illustration of things being thrown away/recycled at the different places
- Talk about differences
- Replace ugly images with video
- Try to make confusion matrix of penn state visible
- Combine image examples with confusion matrix
- Specify prototype in conclusion slide
- Conclusion slide of a college student recycling (Possibly no text)
